*** IMPORTANT DETAILS ***

1-Server DOES NOT implement interprocess communication- you can have only one client interacting with server(that option will be added later)

2-Server has 6 main functions
    
    LOG- simply logging into user account.
    MSG- command for sending message(man command explain more   about this)
    LIST- listing all users 
    INBOX-command for checking your messages
    OUT- logging out from your account
    exit- close program
    
3-Server is using text files to store informations


4-HOW TO USE?
    COMPILE WITH  gcc: gcc mysrv.c -o mysrv
    RUN WITH:               ./mysrv
    
    Open another terminral then use nc command line tool to connect to server. 
    EXAMPLE: nc 127.0.0.1 12345
    Create two or more users and then simply sent & read text messages between them.

Looking to add features:
    * Interprocess communication-multiple clients
    * Removing text files and storing informations in databasses(Using sqlite api)
    * Adding feature of file sharing
