# Network-server
Building simple network server using C programming language


Server is built using socket programming in C programming language. 

*** IMPORTANT ***

1-Server DOES NOT implement interprocess communication- you can have only one client interacting with server(that option will be added later)

2-Server has 4 main functions
    
    LOG- simply logging into user account.
    MSG- command for sending message(man command explain more about this)
    LIST- listing all users 
    INBOX-command for checking your messages
    OUT- logging out from your account
    exit- close program
